# KickstarterSQL

This small repository contains the output files of an admssion task from a local Canadian Data Science Bootcamp.
The files include: 
A text file consisting of some of the SQL queries used to analyze patterns in the crowdfunding data to support a decision included in the report. 
A final report, very short and extremely legible for non technical audeinces. The goal of this report was to determine the viability of a crowdfunding investment project.
